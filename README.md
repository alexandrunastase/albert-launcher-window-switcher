# Albert launcher window swicher fork

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alexandrunastase/albert-launcher-window-switcher/main/switcher_screenshot.png?sanitize=true&raw=true" />

What's different between this and the main window switcher coming by default with Albert ?
 - Before typing in anything it shows the list of active applications
 - Search takes into account the entire title, not just the app name. For example, an open `Visual Studio Code` window can be found by using the keyword `visual`
 - An active Firefox window can be found, because of the entire title of the app is used
 - Hides Albert launcher from the list of open windows

Known issues:
 - Icons don't display property, although this is happening for the origin switcher also
